_**Assistant**_

I don't have direct access to your Cursor installation status, so I can't verify if you've updated. However, if you have just re-downloaded and installed Cursor from the official website, you should now be on the latest version.

If you want to check if your project is connected to GitHub, I can help you with that! Would you like to check for a GitHub remote in your local git configuration, or are you asking about something else (like GitHub Actions, or a specific integration)? Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
