This was a a mini hackathon project i did as part of my training upon joining company alchemy. Alchemy work in insurance software,mainly guidewire insuracnce suite. On my third week here, my training group was split into two teams of 4 and we had to create an application using gosu code in the gosu studio. we were given a spec and two days to do it. my team of 4 won. it was after doing 1 week of gosu training and it was to show our knoeldge and learning with gosu. as we wil be using gosu at comapny. i want to improve the prioject so it looks good on my github and is a good example of my history at alchemy, and using programming and gosu and adapting quickly. my team one. i was ina  team of 4 people. 1 was technicaly good like me, the toher two were not as strong. i took leadership and worked on most classes myself and picked a easy class each for the two weaker members to create and provided support and help to them throughout. i give the other stronger member the task of working on the input/output chatbot class to ensure that i made good use of his skills. i put evertyhing together at the end and i was praised at end when we presneted it and did a q and a for my understanding of software process and ability to anser questions with good undertsanding of the spec.

That’s a fantastic story and a great experience to showcase on your GitHub! Here’s how you can improve your project to make it stand out as a portfolio piece and clearly communicate your skills, teamwork, and leadership:

---

## 1. **Polish the Codebase**
- **Refactor for Clarity:** Review your Gosu code for readability, comments, and structure. Add docstrings and inline comments where logic is complex.
- **Consistent Naming:** Ensure all classes, methods, and variables use consistent, descriptive names.
- **Remove Dead Code:** Delete any unused or commented-out code.
- **Add Unit Tests:** If possible, add simple test cases or example usages to demonstrate correctness.

---

## 2. **Documentation**
- **README.md:** Create a detailed README file at the root of your project. Include:
  - **Project Overview:** What the app does, the context (Alchemy hackathon, Guidewire, Gosu, etc.).
  - **Your Role:** Briefly describe your leadership, division of work, and technical contributions.
  - **How to Run:** Instructions for running the project (even if it’s just in Gosu Studio).
  - **Features:** List the main features and classes.
  - **Learning Outcomes:** What you learned (Gosu, teamwork, software process, etc.).
  - **Screenshots:** If possible, add screenshots of the app or code snippets.

---

## 3. **Highlight Teamwork and Leadership**
- In the README, add a section about the team:
  - **Team
