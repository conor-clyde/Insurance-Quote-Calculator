# Improving my hackathon project for GitHub (2025-07-08 08:26Z)

_**User**_

This was a a mini hackathon project i did as part of my training upon joining company alchemy. Alchemy work in insurance software,mainly guidewire insuracnce suite. On my third week here, my training group was split into two teams of 4 and we had to create an application using gosu code in the gosu studio. we were given a spec and two days to do it. my team of 4 won. it was after doing 1 week of gosu training and it was to show our knoeldge and learning with gosu. as we wil be using gosu at comapny. i want to improve the prioject so it looks good on my github and is a good example of my history at alchemy, and using programming and gosu and adapting quickly. my team one. i was ina  team of 4 people. 1 was technicaly good like me, the toher two were not as strong. i took leadership and worked on most classes myself and picked a easy class each for the two weaker members to create and provided support and help to them throughout. i give the other stronger member the task of working on the input/output chatbot class to ensure that i made good use of his skills. i put evertyhing together at the end and i was praised at end when we presneted it and did a q and a for my understanding of software process and ability to anser questions with good undertsanding of the spec.

That’s a fantastic story and a great experience to showcase on your GitHub! Here’s how you can improve your project to make it stand out as a portfolio piece and clearly communicate your skills, teamwork, and leadership:

---

## 1. **Polish the Codebase**
- **Refactor for Clarity:** Review your Gosu code for readability, comments, and structure. Add docstrings and inline comments where logic is complex.
- **Consistent Naming:** Ensure all classes, methods, and variables use consistent, descriptive names.
- **Remove Dead Code:** Delete any unused or commented-out code.
- **Add Unit Tests:** If possible, add simple test cases or example usages to demonstrate correctness.

---

## 2. **Documentation**
- **README.md:** Create a detailed README file at the root of your project. Include:
  - **Project Overview:** What the app does, the context (Alchemy hackathon, Guidewire, Gosu, etc.).
  - **Your Role:** Briefly describe your leadership, division of work, and technical contributions.
  - **How to Run:** Instructions for running the project (even if it’s just in Gosu Studio).
  - **Features:** List the main features and classes.
  - **Learning Outcomes:** What you learned (Gosu, teamwork, software process, etc.).
  - **Screenshots:** If possible, add screenshots of the app or code snippets.

---

## 3. **Highlight Teamwork and Leadership**
- In the README, add a section about the team:
  - **Team Structure:** 4 members, your leadership role, how you supported others.
  - **Division of Work:** Who did what (without naming if you prefer privacy).
  - **Collaboration:** How you coordinated, helped weaker members, and ensured project success.

---

## 4. **Showcase Technical Skills**
- **Gosu Usage:** Mention that you learned and used Gosu in just a week.
- **Guidewire Context:** Explain the relevance to insurance software and Guidewire.
- **Software Process:** Briefly describe how you approached the spec, divided tasks, and integrated everything.

---

## 5. **Make it Easy to Explore**
- **File Structure:** Add a section in the README explaining the purpose of each main file/class.
- **Entry Point:** Clearly indicate the main file to run (e.g., `RunMe.gsp`).

---

## 6. **Add a Project Summary for GitHub**
- In your GitHub project description, summarize:
  - “Mini hackathon project for Alchemy (Guidewire/insurance software) using Gosu. Led a team of 4, handled most core logic, and supported teammates. Demonstrates rapid learning, leadership, and software process skills.”

---

## 7. **Optional: Add a LICENSE**
- If you want others to use or learn from your code, add an open-source license (e.g., MIT).

---

### **Next Steps**

Would you like help drafting a README.md, refactoring code, or adding comments/tests?  
Let me know which part you want to start with, and I can guide you or generate content/code for you!

---

_**User**_

YES, Help

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Let’s break this down into actionable steps to make your project shine on GitHub. Here’s what I recommend:

---

### **Step 1: Draft a Professional README.md**

This is the most important first step for making your project presentable and understandable to others. I’ll generate a draft for you, tailored to your story and project.

---

### **Step 2: Codebase Polish**

- Add comments and docstrings to your Gosu files.
- Ensure consistent naming and remove any dead code.
- (Optional) Add example usages or test cases if possible.

---

### **Step 3: Highlight Teamwork and Leadership**

- Add a section in the README about your team, your role, and how you led and supported others.

---

### **Step 4: (Optional) Add a LICENSE**

- I can add an MIT license if you want to make your code open-source.

---

#### **Let’s Start with the README**

I’ll generate a professional README.md draft for your project, including all the sections discussed.  
After that, we can move on to code comments, file explanations, and any other improvements you want.

**Does that sound good?**  
If yes, do you want to include your teammates’ names (or just refer to them as “team members”)?  
And do you want to add a license, or keep it private for now?

---

_**User**_

Yes. just team members. what do umean licenses

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect, I’ll refer to your collaborators as “team members” in the README.

### What is a License?

A **license** in a GitHub project tells others what they are allowed to do with your code. For example:
- **MIT License:** Lets anyone use, copy, modify, and share your code, as long as they credit you.
- **GPL, Apache, etc.:** Other open-source licenses with different rules.
- **No License:** By default, if you don’t add a license, others technically can’t use, copy, or modify your code.

**Why add a license?**
- If you want others to learn from, use, or build on your code, adding a license (like MIT) is a good idea.
- If you want to keep it private or just for your portfolio, you can skip it.

**Would you like to add an MIT license, or keep it unlicensed for now?**

---

**Next:**  
I’ll start by drafting a professional README.md for your project, referring to your collaborators as “team members.”  
Let me know your license preference, and we’ll proceed!

---

_**User**_

kee rivate

---

_**Assistant**_

Got it! We’ll keep the project private (no license added), so only you (or those you share it with) can use or view the code.

### Next Step: README.md Draft

I’ll now generate a professional README.md for your project, highlighting:
- The project context (Alchemy, Guidewire, Gosu, hackathon)
- Your role and leadership
- Teamwork and division of work
- Features and file structure
- How to run the project
- Learning outcomes

Let’s get started!

_**User**_

this is the ide

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for sharing the screenshot of your IDE (Gosu Lab) and the `Vehicle.gs` class! This helps me understand your working environment and how your code is structured.

### Next Steps: Code Polish Example

Let’s start by improving your `Vehicle.gs` file as an example. Here’s what I recommend:
- Add a file-level docstring at the top describing the purpose of the class.
- Add docstrings/comments for each property and function.
- Ensure variable and function names are clear and consistent.

---

#### **Example of How to Polish `Vehicle.gs`**

```gosu
// Vehicle.gs
// Represents a vehicle in the insurance application.
// Stores vehicle details and provides methods for premium calculation and info display.

package scratch

class Vehicle {
  // The make/brand of the vehicle (e.g., BMW, Tesla)
  var _make : String as Make
  // The model of the vehicle (e.g., 3 Series, Model S)
  var _model : String as Model
  // The manufacturing year of the vehicle
  var _year : int as Year
  // The registration identifier
  var _reg : String as Reg
  // The market value of the vehicle
  var _value : double as Value
  // Whether the vehicle has a tracker installed
  var _hasTracker : boolean as HasTracker

  /**
   * Calculates the insurance premium multiplier based on the vehicle make.
   * @return double - premium multiplier for this vehicle
   */
  function calculateVehiclePremium() : double {
    switch(_make) {
      case 'BMW 3 Series':
        return 0.15
      case 'Tesla Model S':
        return 0.50
      case 'Ferrari F430':
        return 1.00
      case 'Rolls Royce Phantom':
        return 5.00
      default:
        return 0.0
    }
  }

  /**
   * Prints the vehicle's make to the console.
   */
  function printInfo() {
    print('Make: ${_make}')
  }
}
```

---

**Would you like me to:**
- Apply these improvements to your `Vehicle.gs` file?
- Or would you like to focus on another file or area first?

Let me know your preference, and I’ll proceed!

Before we continue, I wanted to say, this was the sec we were given: Graduate Hackathon 2023
Overview
Alchemy Insurance Services are in the market for a chatbot.
They want you to create an MVP Quote and Buy application that will ask for a customer’s data, process it, and quote the user a premium inclusive of IPT.
The information required from the user is:
• Customer info – name, preferred gender, date of birth (to calculate age), date of licence (to calculate number of years driving), and occupation
• Address – house / flat number, street, postcode. Alchemy Insurance is only available to residents of Derry City in Northern Ireland (BT47 / BT48 postcodes).
• Driving history – number of motoring convictions / non-motoring convictions
• Claims history – number of fault / non-fault claims
• Vehicle info – Alchemy Insurance only covers a handful of specific vehicles. All other vehicles must be declined. Information required is Vehicle Make, Model, Year of Manufacture, Registration, and Value.
The required information should be summarised for the user so the user can confirm if it is correct. If any information is incorrect, the quote is cancelled and the user must start over.
Once the user confirms the information is correct, their individual premium is displayed. The user can then either accept or decline the quote.
Alchemy Insurance’s minimum premium is £300 + IPT.
If Alchemy Insurance can quote the user, the total amount should show:
Insurance Premium + IPT @ 12% of premium = Total Payable
Rating Guide
Vehicle information
Alchemy Insurance only offers cover for the following cars subject to individual rating: Ford Focus + 0%
BMW 3 Series + 15% Tesla Model S + 50%
Ferrari F430 + 100%
Rolls Royce Phantom + 500%
If the vehicle is worth more than £100,000, the vehicle must be fitted with a tracker. If no tracker is fitted, the user must agree to fit one within 30 days or the quote is declined.
Accepted Customers
Alchemy Insurance is only available to customers aged 21 - 85 years inclusive.
All occupations are acceptable with the exception of Professional Gambler.
Alchemy Insurance offers a discount of -10% to Doctors, Nurses, and Teachers.
Drivers who have held their licence for 5 years or more get a discount of -5%.
Accepted Addresses
Alchemy Insurance is only available to customers with a BT47 or a BT48 postcode.
Customers with any BT47 postcode get a -5% discount.
Customers with most BT48 postcodes must pay an additional +10%.
Customers with any BT48 6(XX) postcode must pay an additional +15% due to a recent surge of theft claims in the area.
Driving History
If the driver has 3 penalty points, their premium increases by +20% If the driver has 6 penalty points, their premium increases by +50%
If the driver has more than 6 penalty points, the quotation is declined.
If the driver has any non-motoring conviction, the quotation is declined.
Claims History
The driver is not penalised for 3 or fewer non-fault accidents in the past 5 years.
However, if the driver has more than 3 non-fault accidents, the quotation is declined.
If the driver has 1 fault accident, they must pay an additional +50%
If the driver has 2 fault accidents, they must pay an additional +100%
If the driver has 3 or more fault accidents, the quote is declined.

Your README.md has been further polished!  
It now clearly highlights your ACE certification in Guidewire ClaimCenter, clarifies the business context, and presents your project, role, and achievements in a professional and concise way.

**Key improvements:**
- Added a “Certification & Training” section to showcase your ACE certification.
- Clarified the business and technical context.
- Improved the flow and professionalism of each section.
- Made your leadership and teamwork stand out.
- Ensured the business rules and project story are easy to follow.

---

If you’d like to add screenshots, future improvements, or want feedback on your next edits, just let me know!  
You’re now set up with a README that will impress both technical and non-technical viewers.

---

_**User**_

this part came after the gosu trianing: 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great clarification! To make your README even clearer and more impressive, you can explicitly state that the hackathon project was completed **after** your week of Gosu training and that it served as a practical application of what you learned.

### Here’s how you can phrase it in your README:

---

**In the “Overview” or “Project Context” section:**

> This project was developed as part of a hackathon during my graduate training at Alchemy, a company specializing in insurance software and the Guidewire Insurance Suite. After completing an intensive week of Gosu training, my team of four was challenged to build an insurance-related application using Gosu in just two days. Our project won the competition, demonstrating rapid learning, teamwork, and adaptability.

---

**Or, in a timeline format:**

- **Week 1:** Completed intensive Gosu and Guidewire ClaimCenter training, including hands-on labs and environment setup.
- **Week 2:** Participated in the Alchemy Graduate Hackathon, applying new Gosu skills to build a Quote & Buy chatbot MVP in just two days.

---

**You can also add a sentence to the “Gosu Training & Setup” section:**

> The hackathon immediately followed this training, providing an opportunity to apply new skills in a real-world, time-pressured scenario.

---

Would you like me to update your README with this improved phrasing, or would you like to make the edit yourself?

---

_**User**_

i meant this cam eafter gosu trianign so is unrelated to project: 

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for clarifying!  
You’re absolutely right: the **ACE certification in Guidewire ClaimCenter** was a separate achievement after your Gosu training and the hackathon project, and not directly related to the hackathon itself.

### How to Clarify This in Your README

You can make this clear by adjusting the “Certification & Training” section. Here’s a suggested revision:

---

#### **Current Section:**
```
## Certification & Training
As part of my onboarding at Alchemy, I became **ACE certified in Guidewire ClaimCenter** at an official exam center. This certification validated my understanding of the Guidewire platform and gave me a strong foundation for working on real-world insurance software projects. The training and certification process included:
- Intensive hands-on labs and coursework on Guidewire ClaimCenter
- Study of both technical and business aspects of insurance software
- Successful completion of the ACE certification exam
```

#### **Suggested Edit:**
```
## Certification & Training (Beyond the Hackathon)
After completing the Gosu training and the hackathon project, I continued my professional development at Alchemy and became **ACE certified in Guidewire ClaimCenter** at an official exam center. While this certification was not directly related to the hackathon, it further validated my understanding of the Guidewire platform and prepared me for real-world insurance software projects. The certification process included:
- Intensive hands-on labs and coursework on Guidewire ClaimCenter
- Study of both technical and business aspects of insurance software
- Successful completion of the ACE certification exam
```

---

This makes it clear that the ACE certification was a separate, subsequent achievement.

Would you like me to apply this edit for you?

---

_**User**_

I would rather u dont include what came after gosu hackathon

---

_**Assistant**_

Understood!  
To keep your README focused and relevant, you should **remove the “Certification & Training” section** (or any mention of ACE certification) since it was not part of the Gosu hackathon project.

### Here’s what you should do:
- Delete the section about ACE certification and ClaimCenter.
- Keep the README focused on the Gosu training, the hackathon, your project, and your role.

---

**Would you like me to remove that section for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?**  
Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

---

_**User**_

myself

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! That’s a great choice—editing it yourself ensures your README reflects exactly what you want to highlight.

If you need a quick review, suggestions, or help with any other part of your README or project, just let me know.  
Good luck with your edits!

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Remove ACE Certification Reference (if unrelated):**
   - You mentioned you don’t want to include what came after the hackathon. The line in “Learning Outcomes”:
     > - Achieved ACE certification in Guidewire ClaimCenter, validating my technical and business knowledge
   - **Recommendation:** Remove this line to keep the README focused on the hackathon project.

2. **Minor Formatting:**
   - There’s a stray `--` before the “Tech Stack” section. You can remove it for a cleaner look.

3. **Optional: Expand “Gosu Training & Setup”**
   - You could add a sentence or two about what the training covered (e.g., “We covered Gosu fundamentals, hands-on labs, and environment setup to prepare for the hackathon.”)

4. **Optional: Add a “Screenshots” or “Demo” Section**
   - If you have any screenshots of the IDE or the app running, a visual can make your project even more engaging.

_**User**_

does it include too much info or is it good. also how to run should maybe be better like xplaining to install the studio from gosu

---

_**Assistant**_

Your README.md is very strong and professional! Here’s a quick assessment and some suggestions:

---

## **Is There Too Much Info?**
- **No, it’s not too much.**  
  The level of detail is appropriate for a portfolio project, especially since it demonstrates your understanding of business requirements, technical skills, and teamwork.
- **Why it works:**  
  - The “Specification” section shows the real-world complexity you handled.
  - The “Project Context” and “My Role & Teamwork” sections highlight your leadership and technical contributions.
  - The “How to Run” and “File Structure” sections make it easy for others to try your project.
- **If you want to shorten it:**  
  You could move some of the business rules to a collapsible section or a separate file, but for most technical recruiters or collaborators, the current format is excellent.

---

## **Improving the “How to Run” Section**

You’re right—adding a brief guide on installing Gosu Studio (or Gosu Lab) will help others run your project more easily. Here’s a suggested replacement:

---

### **Improved “How to Run” Section**

```markdown
## How to Run

1. **Install Gosu Studio (Gosu Lab):**
   - Download the latest Gosu distribution from the [official Gosu website](https://gosu-lang.github.io/).
   - Install Java JDK 1.8 if you don’t have it already.
   - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK 1.8 installation.
   - Unzip the Gosu distribution and run `gosu.cmd` (Windows) or `gosu` (Mac/Linux) from the `bin` folder to launch Gosu Studio (Gosu Lab IDE).

2. **Open the Project:**
   - In Gosu Studio, open the project folder.
   - Navigate to `src/main/gosu/scratch/`.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Open `RunMe.gsp`.
   - Run the script to start the application and interact via the chatbot interface.

> **Note:** This project is designed for demonstration and learning purposes within the Guidewire/Gosu ecosystem.
```

---

This makes your README even more user-friendly and professional, and it provides a direct reference for anyone new to Gosu!

---

_**User**_

is the order of it okay

---

_**Assistant**_

The order and structure of your README.md are excellent and follow best practices for open-source and portfolio projects. Here’s a quick review of your section order and why it works:

---

## **Recommended README Order (and Your README)**

1. **Project Title**  
   _Clear and at the top._

2. **Overview**  
   _Gives immediate context about what the project is, why it was built, and your achievement._

3. **Specification / Business Rules**  
   _Shows the real-world requirements and complexity you handled. This is especially good for technical recruiters or collaborators._

4. **Project Context**  
   _Explains the event, business domain, tech stack, team, and duration. This helps readers understand the environment and constraints._

5. **Gosu Training & Setup**  
   _Briefly explains your preparation and environment, which is useful for those unfamiliar with Gosu._

6. **Your Role & Teamwork**  
   _Highlights your leadership, technical, and collaborative skills. This is a great personal touch._

7. **Tech Stack**  
   _Quickly lists the main technologies used._

8. **File Structure**  
   _Helps readers navigate the codebase easily._

9. **How to Run**  
   _Step-by-step instructions, now improved with a reference to the [Gosu Quickstart guide](https://gosu-lang.github.io/quickstart.html)._

10. **Learning Outcomes**  
    _Summarizes what you learned and your growth during the project._

11. **Acknowledgements**  
    _Shows professionalism and gratitude._

---

## **Why This Order Works**
- It starts with the “what” and “why” (Overview, Specification).
- Then gives context (Project Context, Training).
- Then focuses on your contribution (Role & Teamwork).
- Then helps the reader use the project (Tech Stack, File Structure, How to Run).
- Ends with reflection and thanks (Learning Outcomes, Acknowledgements).

---

## **Summary**
- **Your order is logical, clear, and professional.**
- The only thing you might consider is moving “How to Run” slightly higher (e.g., just after “File Structure”) if you want to prioritize usability for people who want to try your project immediately. But your current order is perfectly acceptable and common.

---

**Reference:**  
For Gosu setup and running instructions, see the [Gosu Quickstart guide](https://gosu-lang.github.io/quickstart.html).

If you want, I can update the README to move “How to Run” higher, or leave it as is—both are good options! Let me know your preference.

_**User**_

can you create a new github reo for this

---

_**Assistant**_

I can guide you step-by-step on how to create a new GitHub repository for your project and push your code to it. Here’s how you can do it:

---

## **How to Create a New GitHub Repository and Push Your Project**

### 1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in.
2. Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., `alchemy-gosu-hackathon`).
4. Add a description (you can use your README overview).
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**.
6. **Do not** initialize with a README (you already have one).
7. Click **Create repository**.

---

### 2. **Push Your Local Project to GitHub**

Open a terminal in your project root (where your `README.md` is) and run:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and the repo name with your actual GitHub username and the name you chose.**

---

### 3. **Check Your Repository**
- Go to your new repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alchemy-gosu-hackathon`)
- You should see all your files, including your polished README.md.

---

### **Optional: Add a .gitignore**
If you want to ignore certain files (like IDE settings), create a `.gitignore` file before running `git add .`.

---

If you want, I can generate a sample `.gitignore` for Gosu/Java projects, or help you with any step in more detail.  
Let me know if you want a command ready to copy-paste, or if you have any questions!

---

_**User**_



---

_**Assistant**_

It looks like you’ve done everything right with your local git commands, but you’re getting this error:

```
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git/' not found
```

This means the remote repository does **not exist** on GitHub, or the URL is incorrect.

---

## **How to Fix**

1. **Create the Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in.
   - Click the **+** in the top right and select **New repository**.
   - Name it `alchemy-gosu-hackathon` (or your preferred name).
   - Do **not** initialize with a README (you already have one).
   - Click **Create repository**.

2. **Update Your Remote URL (if needed):**
   - If you accidentally set the wrong remote, you can change it with:
     ```sh
     git remote set-url origin https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git
     ```

3. **Push Your Code:**
   - Now push your code:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin main
     ```

---

## **Why the Error Happened**
- The error occurs if the repository does not exist on GitHub, or if you use a placeholder like `YOUR_USERNAME` instead of your actual username.
- You must create the repo on GitHub first, then push.

---

_**Assistant**_

Your GitHub repository [conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon](https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon) has been created, but it is currently empty.

### **What to do next:**

1. **Check your remote URL**
   - Make sure your local git remote is set to:  
     `https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git`

2. **If you see “remote origin already exists”**
   - You can update the remote with:
     ```sh
     git remote set-url origin https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git
     ```

3. **Push your code**
   - Run:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - This will upload your local files to the new GitHub repository.

---

After pushing, refresh your repo page ([conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon](https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon)) and you should see all your project files and README.

If you run into any errors, let me know the message and I’ll help you resolve it!

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git
git push -u origin main

---

_**Assistant**_

Your commands are correct for pushing your local project to a new GitHub repository. However, since you already initialized the repo and set the remote, you may get an error like `remote origin already exists`. If so, you only need to update the remote and push.

### **If you haven’t set the remote yet:**
```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **If you see “remote origin already exists”:**
Just update the remote and push:
```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

After running these commands, your code and README should appear at  
[https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon](https://github.com/conor-clyde/alchemy-gosu-hackathon)

If you have any issues or see an error, let me know the message and I’ll help you fix it!

whats  agood naming convention for all my github rpeos

---

_**Assistant**_

A good naming convention for your GitHub repositories should be:

- **Descriptive:** Clearly indicate what the project is about.
- **Consistent:** Use the same style for all repos.
- **Readable:** Easy to read and type (avoid spaces and special characters).
- **Lowercase:** Most developers use lowercase with hyphens or underscores.

---

## **Popular Naming Conventions**

### 1. **Kebab-case (recommended)**
- All lowercase, words separated by hyphens.
- **Example:**  
  - `alchemy-gosu-hackathon`
  - `guidewire-claimcenter-labs`
  - `insurance-quote-chatbot`
  - `personal-website`
- **Why:**  
  - Most common on GitHub.
  - Easy to read and type.
  - Works well in URLs.

### 2. **Snake_case**
- All lowercase, words separated by underscores.
- **Example:**  
  - `alchemy_gosu_hackathon`
  - `guidewire_claimcenter_labs`

### 3. **CamelCase** (less common for repos)
- Each word starts with a capital letter, no spaces.
- **Example:**  
  - `AlchemyGosuHackathon`

---

## **Tips for Naming**
- **Be specific:** `gosu-hackathon-2024` is better than just `hackathon`.
- **Avoid spaces and special characters:** Use hyphens or underscores.
- **Add context if needed:** e.g., `guidewire-training-exercises`, `university-final-project`.
- **Keep it short but clear:** Don’t over-abbreviate.

---

## **Examples for Your Use Case**
- `alchemy-gosu-hackathon`
- `guidewire-claimcenter-examples`
- `insurance-chatbot-mvp`
- `gosu-lab-exercises`
- `personal-portfolio-site`

---

**Summary:**  
Use **kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens) for clarity and consistency.  
Example: `project-purpose-year` → `gosu-hackathon-2024`

If you want, I can suggest names for specific projects—just tell me what they are!
