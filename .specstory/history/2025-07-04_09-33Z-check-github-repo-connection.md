Based on the information provided, I do not have direct access to your GitHub repository settings or remote configuration from within this environment. However, I can help you check if your local project is connected to a GitHub repository by guiding you through a few steps:

### How to Check if Your Project is Connected to a GitHub Repo

1. **Check for a `.git` folder:**  
   In your project directory (`/c:/Users/ConorClyde/Documents/Hackathon`), there should be a hidden `.git` folder if the project is under git version control.

2. **Check the remote URL:**  
   You can check which remote (if any) your local git repository is connected to by running the following command in your project directory:
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   This will list the remote repositories (such as GitHub) that your local repository is connected to.

3. **Look for GitHub URLs:**  
   If you see URLs like `https://github.com/username/repo.git` or `git@github.com:username/repo.git` in the output, your project is connected to a GitHub repository.

Would you like me to propose a command to check the remote configuration for you? If so, I can prepare the command for you to approve and run.

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
PS C:\Users\ConorClyde\Documents\Hackathon> git remote -v
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
PS C:\Users\ConorClyde\Documents\Hackathon> git remote -v
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
PS C:\Users\ConorClyde\Documents\Hackathon>
























PS C:\Users\ConorClyde\Documents\Hackathon>
```

Your project directory is not currently a git repository. This means it is not connected to any GitHub repository (or any git remote at all).

### What does this mean?
- There is no `.git` folder in your project directory.
- You have not yet initialized git in this project, nor connected it to a remote (such as GitHub).

### What can you do next?
If you want to connect this project to a GitHub repository, you need to:
1. Initialize git in your project directory.
2. Create a repository on GitHub (if you haven't already).
3. Add the GitHub repository as a remote.
4. Commit your files and push them to GitHub.

Would you like step-by-step help to set this up? If so, let me know if you already have a GitHub repository created, or if you need help creating one!
